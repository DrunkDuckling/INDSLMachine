# INDSLMachine
Code used from year 3 and the help class held 28-Feb-2020
Merged them together so GUI controls the Statemachine. What you name the buttons is also the name that goes in the where statements. 
The out commented code in the main file, is the other example. Still need a fix for stoppers.. Max power level.
